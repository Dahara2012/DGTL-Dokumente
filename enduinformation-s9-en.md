# Format

With the DGTL Endurance, we present our very first official endurance race. This event stands as an independent highlight, separate from the regular DGTL league operations.

Special Feature: Participating teams will receive a reserved slot for the upcoming DGTL season based on their race result. Thus, the Endurance Race also serves as a small qualification event.

**Key Details:**

- Race Duration: 5 hours
- Track: Silverstone Circuit
- Format: Team race with driver swaps, one car per team
- Qualifying: Open qualifying determines the starting grid
- Practice: A dedicated practice server will be available
- Fuel Limit: 90% tank capacity
- Class: GT3

# Entry Fee

There is no entry fee for this event.

# Prizes

No prizes will be awarded. The only reward is a reserved slot for the upcoming DGTL season for the Top 10 teams of the endurance event. This guarantees the team a fixed spot, provided that registration is completed before the official deadline.

# Registration

Registration takes place via the league Discord (#s9-registrations). A corresponding template can be found there. Please create a separate post for each team. The number of available slots is limited to 50. Deadlines and dates can be found in the league calendar[^3].

# Setups

The setup for all DGTL races is not fixed. Open setups are used.

# Briefing

A briefing takes place before each race. Attendance is not mandatory, but it is the last opportunity to ask questions prior to the race. All information communicated during the briefing can also be found in the briefing document. Please note that the document may still be updated up until the briefing. Familiarity with all information communicated in the briefing is required.

During the briefing, any changes to procedures may be announced. Rules that have recently caused issues will be reiterated, race control notices will be read out, and applied or pending penalties will be addressed. The briefing document also includes details regarding the weather and InSim settings of the sessions.

# Wetter

Dynamic weather is used for all DGTL sessions. The exact conditions for each session are therefore not known in advance. The briefing document will provide the parameters used to generate the weather (rain probability, temperature, wind speed). A detailed weather report will be published on the day before each race.

# Roster

A roster includes all drivers eligible to race for a team. Each roster is limited to 5 drivers. The team leader can modify their team roster by submitting changes to the organization via the designated team leader channel on Discord. Processing requests for roster changes may take up to 24 hours, so please register drivers well in advance of a race.

# Postponement

The race commission reserves the right to suspend, postpone, or cancel the event on race day in case of technical or other issues. If a replacement date is scheduled, it will be announced promptly via Discord (#announcements).

# Livestream

Races will be broadcast live whenever possible. Broadcasting a DGTL event without prior permission is not allowed. An exception is a broadcast that focuses solely on a team’s own car and does not attempt to provide an overview of the entire race. Such broadcasts are permitted without special permission.

# Rules, Penalties, and Protests

Race sessions are monitored by a live race commission. Penalties are issued in real time. Incidents are adjudicated according to the current version of the Dahara Standard Rulebook. Information on how to file protests can be found in the rulebook.
